//Java is a case-sensitive language
//java program begins with a class
//class-collections of methods and variables
//variable is (x)=20 variable is a memory location where you can store values
//method==a collection of statements--it for reusability-->no.of statements grouped into a single unit
//methods are used for reusability
//class name should start with upper case and every internal word must start with upper case
//main--is method and main is king of method
//new is an object datatype or reference datatype
//constructor--?
//object-->class name x->is object=new class name(); +++x.method();
//notes:from your main method if you want to call any methods or variable then we must create object to the class
//object is also called as instance or reference
//new is called as object datatype or reference datatype
//datatypes must be lowercase.
//datatypes===primitive and reference or object datatypes
